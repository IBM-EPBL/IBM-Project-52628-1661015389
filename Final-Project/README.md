#Efficient Water Quality Analysis & Prediction using Machine Learning


## About Project

Water is considered as a vital resource that affects various aspects of human health and lives. The quality of water is a major concern for people living in urban areas. The quality of water serves as a powerful environmental determinant and a foundation for the prevention and control of waterborne diseases. However predicting the urban water quality is a challenging task since the water quality varies in urban spaces non-linearly and depends on multiple factors, such as meteorology, water usage patterns, and land uses, so this project aims at building a Machine Learning (ML) model to Predict Water Quality by considering all water quality standard indicators

Currently, Our Trained model has an accuracy of 97% and at a certain level it shows a level of prediction of the output.

## Run Instructions

> Notes:
> 1. Some paths are Absolute paths and hence may cause the program to break. Kindly check and replace those paths as required.
> 2. Currently only works in __Firefox__ Web Browser due to some security requirement in __Chromium__ Based Browsers

* Run the Web App
	1. Install any one of the interface to run code either Anaconda or Jupyter.
	2. Execute the WebApp using ```flask run``` or ```app.py```
	3.Change the directory before running the code in app.py
	4. The IP address for the webpage will be available at the output terminal

* Train the Model
	1. Open ```Project\Urban_water_Prediction.ipynb```
	2. Change Paths to Dataset
	3. Run the Notebook
